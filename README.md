# Period_Underground
Period Tracker that keeps all data on device
This app is a basic QT 6.3 app that works on Mac (M1 or x86), Windows, Linux, and Android to locally store period data and estimate when the next period will be. It does not track fertility, and should not be used as a way to track the Rythm method, Natural Family Planning, or other forms of birth control to prevent pregnancy. It is released under the GNU Public License V3.
The app uses shades of red to show bleeding, grey for spotting, and green for the next expected period.
